            <p>I have studied Combined Maths, Physics and Chemistry for my A levels and I always loved learning about new technologies and doing research regarding them. I was a passionate tennis player since I was 8 and I currently represent the UOC tennis team. I loved mathematics since my childhood and I was always keen towards the subject. While I was studying in the university I took computer science as my major subject and was introduced to programming. Apart from them, I work in societies such as CSMUOC, IEEE UCSC, Rotaract UOC.</p>
            <p>I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.</p>
