            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>I have studied IT with Mathematics and Physics but have always been interested in Designing and web development. I was 10 years old when I made my first web page with HTML and CSS. In the meantime I also did some designing work as well. While I was studying in the university I took computer science as my major subject and was introduced to programming. Apart from them, I work in societies such as CSMUOC, IEEE UCSC, IEEE CS chapter, WIE and INSL.</p>
            <p>I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.</p>
            <p>Thank You!</p>
